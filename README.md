# Corner-Grocer
Welcome to Corner Grocer! This program analyzes records of items purchased throughout the day, from store opening to closing. Our goal is to optimize the layout of our produce section by determining 
the frequency of item purchases. This helps us create a more efficient and customer-friendly arrangement.

Here are a few things I feel I did well:
File Handling: The code effectively reads and writes to files, ensuring smooth data handling.
User Interaction: It provides a clear and intuitive menu for user interaction, making it easy for users to navigate.
Data Management: Keeping track of item frequencies using a map is a smart choice, making it simple to update and retrieve data.
Resource Handling: The code properly closes file resources, preventing memory leaks and ensuring efficient resource management.
Functionality: The program successfully accomplishes its main task of tracking and analyzing item frequencies, enhancing store management capabilities.
Organization: The code is well-structured and organized into a class, making it modular and easy to maintain.
Overall, these aspects contribute to a robust and functional program that effectively serves its purpose.

Here are some things that could make it even better:
Check Files: Ensure files open properly and handle cases where they can't be opened or read.
Validate Inputs: Make sure users pick valid choices from the menu.
Keep Data Safe: Keep the item frequency data inside the class and control access to it.
Make it Faster: Optimize code for better performance, especially for large input files.
Handle Errors: Deal with unexpected situations gracefully, showing useful messages to users.
Implementing these changes will make the code better, safer, and easier to understand for everyone.

Implementing the "PrintHist()" function was tough for me. Getting the asterisks aligned with item names while managing loop logic and string manipulation was tricky. 
Also, creating a visually intuitive histogram layout that effectively shows frequency distribution required creativity and problem-solving. 
It took careful attention to detail and understanding of output formatting, loop control, and visualization techniques to make it work.

Through this project, I've gained skills that I know I can use in other projects and coursework. I've learned how to handle files, which I know will be helpful whenever I need to read or write data. 
Working with data structures like maps has taught me how to organize and manage information effectively. Figuring out how to solve problems, like tracking item frequencies, has improved my ability to 
think logically and come up with solutions. Creating a class to manage data showed me how to design code in a way that's easy to understand and use. Dealing with errors and figuring out how to handle 
unexpected situations has made me better at writing code that's reliable and doesn't break easily. Plus, building a user-friendly interface has shown me how to design software that's easy for people to 
interact with. Overall, this project has given me a lot of useful skills that I know I'll be able to use in the future.

I made sure this program is easy to understand, change, and use. I divided it into smaller parts, each doing one thing, so it's not confusing. I gave everything clear names so it's obvious what each part does. 
Also, I wrote comments to explain complicated parts and how everything works. I kept the writing style the same all through the program, so it looks neat and organized.
If something goes wrong, I made sure the program doesn't crash but tells the user what happened. Plus, I made it so you can easily change things like file names or how it behaves
without messing up everything. Overall, I did my best to make this program simple, clear, and flexible.
